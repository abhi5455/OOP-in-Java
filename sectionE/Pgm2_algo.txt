Step 1: Start
Step 2:Main function is invoked
         a. Randomizer rz = new Randomizer
         b. Start method is called
Step 3:Define thread class randomizer
         a.Run method is defined
            i. In this run method a random number id generated
            ii. For i = 0 to i <10 do
         1. N = r.nextInt(100)
         2. If n % 2 == 0
         a. An object for even class is created and start
            method is called
         3. Else
         a. An object of odd class is created and start
            method is called
Step 4:Define thread class even
         a.Run method is defined
         i.Display the square of the number
Step 5:Define thread class odd
         a.Run method is defined
         i.Display the cube of the number
Step 6:Stop
