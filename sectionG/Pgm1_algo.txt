Step 1: Start
Step 2: A class doubly linked list is defined
         a. Declare Node head, newnode, temp and ptr
         b. Node class is defined
         i. Declare data and pointers prev and link
         ii. Using this keyword prev and link is assigned to null
         c. Insert function is created
         i. New node is created
         ii. If head is null
         1. Head = new node
         2. Temp = new node
         iii. Else
         1. Temp.link = new node
         2. Temp = new node
         iv. Print insertion successful
         d. Delete function is created
         i. If head = null
         1. Print list is empty
         ii. Else
         1. If head.link = null
         a. Head = head.link
         2. Else
         a. Ptr = head;
         b. Head = head.link
         c. Head.prev = null
         e. Display function is created
         i. Ptr = head
         ii. While ptr != null
         1. Print ptr.data
         2. Prt = ptr.link
Step 3: Main class is invoked
         a. An object dll is created for the class doubly linked list
         b. Initialize choice variable as zero
         c. While choice != 4
         i. Switch choice
         1. If input value is 1
         a. A data is received from the user
         b. Insert function is called
         2. If input value is 2
         a. Delete function is called
         3. If input value is 3
         a. Display function is called
         4. If input value is 4
         a. Exit from the program
Step 4: Stop
