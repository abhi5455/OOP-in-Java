Step 1: Start
Step 2:Input a string s
Step 3:Create a class CharacterFrequencyCounter
Step 4:Initialize a private string variable inputString in the class
Step 5:Create a constructor that takes a string parameter and sets
       inputString to the parameter value
Step 6:Create a method calculateCharacterFrequency() in the class
       Initialize an empty HashMap to store character frequencies
       - For each character c in inputString
       - If c is a letter
       - Convert c to lowercase to treat uppercase and lowercase as the
         same character
       - Update the frequency in the HashMap
       - Display the character frequencies in the HashMap
Step 7:Stop
